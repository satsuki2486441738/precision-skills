# Metric definitions

## Coordinates

Pair scores by sample/prediction position/token and tensors by logical parameter/element. Check expected coordinates, masks and ranks. Exclude padding, deduplicate equal replicas, and retain differing replicas as explicit views. Distinguish absent gradients from present zeros.

## Target-token scores

For two executions' logprobs $\ell_{a,i},\ell_{b,i}$ over $N$ valid targets, use:

- $\mathrm{NLL}_s=-\sum_i\ell_{s,i}/N$; report each side's NLL and their absolute difference.
- $e_i=|\ell_{a,i}-\ell_{b,i}|$; report MAE, P99 and maximum with its coordinate.

Use the global valid-target count. Native loss retains its implemented reduction. Percentiles use all paired errors, linearly interpolated at $a(N-1)$; P99 uses $a=0.99$.

Distribution metrics are defined in [inference](inference.md#top-100-distribution-comparison).

## Tensors

For paired tensors $a$ and $b$, use stable FP64 reductions:

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| L2 error | $\lVert a-b\rVert_2$ |
| RMSE | $\lVert a-b\rVert_2/\sqrt{N}$ |
| Cosine | $a^\top b/(\lVert a\rVert_2\lVert b\rVert_2)$ |
| Maximum absolute error | $\max_i|a_i-b_i|$ |

Global metrics concatenate coordinates. Retain counts and signal/error norms. Actual updates are $\theta_{after}-\theta_{before}$, promoting stored values to at least FP32 before subtraction.

Cosine is undefined when either norm is zero. Represent undefined metrics as null with a reason.

Use finite target scores/tensors; distribution logprobs permit `-inf` for zero probability. Compare user-supplied tolerances to the computed metric and aggregation.
